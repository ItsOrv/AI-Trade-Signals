## Project Structure

This project is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose. Below is a detailed description of each component in the structure:

### `data_pipeline/`

This directory handles the entire data flow, from fetching to preprocessing and storage.

- **`data_fetcher.py`**  
  This file is responsible for collecting historical market data from various sources, such as cryptocurrency exchanges. It includes functions to connect to APIs, fetch data, and handle errors that may occur during data retrieval.

- **`data_preprocessor.py`**  
  This module is used to clean and preprocess the fetched data. It includes functions for handling missing values, normalizing data, and transforming the data into a suitable format for model training. It ensures that the input data is ready for analysis.

- **`data_storage.py`**  
  This file manages the storage of processed data. It can include functions to save data to a local database, write to CSV files, or store data in other formats for later retrieval. The main goal is to ensure that data is readily accessible for future analysis or model training.

- **`config.py`**  
  This configuration file contains settings and parameters used throughout the data pipeline, such as API keys, database connection details, and other necessary constants. This allows for easy adjustments without altering the core logic of the data fetching and preprocessing.

### `models/`

This directory contains the machine learning models used for trading signal generation.

- **`model_training.py`**  
  This file is responsible for training the machine learning models using the preprocessed data. It includes functions for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, fitting the model, and saving the trained model for future use.

- **`model_evaluation.py`**  
  This module evaluates the performance of the trained models using various metrics. It helps in assessing how well the models predict the price movements based on historical data and includes functions to generate confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and other relevant evaluation metrics.

- **`lstm_model.py`**  
  This file implements the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is used for predicting future prices based on past trends. It contains functions to build, compile, and fit the LSTM model to the training data, as well as methods for making predictions.

- **`trade_signals.py`**  
  This module generates trading signals based on the predictions from the LSTM model and other technical indicators. It includes logic to determine buy/sell signals based on predefined thresholds or conditions and integrates these signals into the trading strategy.

- **`config.py`**  
  Similar to the `data_pipeline/config.py`, this configuration file holds model-specific settings, such as hyperparameters for training, model architecture details, and paths for saving models.

### `strategy/`

This directory contains files related to trading strategies, including technical analysis and risk management.

- **`technical_indicators.py`**  
  This file defines various technical indicators, such as Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, etc. These indicators help in analyzing market trends and making informed trading decisions.

- **`risk_management.py`**  
  This module implements risk management strategies, ensuring that the trading bot operates within predefined risk parameters. It includes functions for setting stop-loss and take-profit levels, position sizing, and overall capital management.

- **`backtesting.py`**  
  This file allows users to test their trading strategies against historical data to evaluate performance before deploying them in real trading. It includes logic for simulating trades, tracking performance metrics, and generating reports.

- **`strategy.py`**  
  This is the main file where the overall trading strategy is defined. It integrates various components, including signals generated from the machine learning model and indicators from `technical_indicators.py`, to make final trading decisions.

### `trading_engine/`

This directory handles the execution of trades on the exchange.

- **`trade_execution.py`**  
  This file is responsible for executing buy and sell orders on the selected trading platform. It uses APIs provided by exchanges to place orders, manage order types (market, limit), and handle execution errors.

- **`position_manager.py`**  
  This module manages the open positions in the market. It tracks current holdings, monitors price movements, and implements logic for exiting trades based on predefined conditions or signals.

- **`order_management.py`**  
  This file deals with the overall management of orders, including placing new orders, canceling existing ones, and tracking their status. It ensures that all trades are executed as intended and provides functions for retrieving order history.

### `logs/`

This directory is dedicated to logging functionalities.

- **`log_manager.py`**  
  This file manages logging throughout the application. It includes functions to log important events, such as data fetching, model training, trade executions, and errors. Proper logging helps in debugging and monitoring the performance of the trading bot.

### `utils/`

This directory includes utility functions that are used across the project.

- **`utils.py`**  
  This file contains helper functions that are commonly used throughout the project, such as data formatting, error handling, or any repetitive tasks that donâ€™t fit into other specific modules.

- **`api_connector.py`**  
  This module handles the connection to external APIs, including those for data fetching and trade execution. It ensures that the application can communicate effectively with different services, handling authentication and data retrieval.

### Additional Files

- **`requirements.txt`**  
  This file lists all the required Python packages and their versions needed to run the project. Users can install all dependencies easily with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- **`config.py`**  
  This is the main configuration file for the project, containing global settings and parameters used throughout various modules.

- **`main.py`**  
  This is the entry point of the application. It initializes the various components, orchestrates the flow of data, and runs the trading bot. Users execute this file to start the trading process.
